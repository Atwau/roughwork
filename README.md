The purpose of this folder is to work as a rough work folder

For testing all the software which I download

For example
- I installed fastqc using sudo apt install fastqc
- now I want to download sequence data from SRA to test it
- so I will download files inside the roughwork folder
- put into folder called testfastqc
- then perform the test I want

Thank you
